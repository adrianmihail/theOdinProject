        <h3>Description</h3>
        <a>We make this St. Patrick's Day dinner every year with this family recipe that's been handed down through several generations. The mustard sauce is incredibly smooth and tasty — add a bit of horseradish to make it even better! If you already have a favorite corned beef recipe, you could make this sauce to serve with it.</a>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Corned Beef</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>To make the corned beef: Place corned beef into a 6-quart Dutch oven, and pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, skimming the liquid occasionally to remove fat from the top. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Arrange cabbage, potatoes, onions, and carrots around beef; return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender and beef can easily be pulled apart with a fork, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer beef to a serving platter. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and arrange around beef. Reserve 1 ½ cups cooking liquid for the sauce.</li>
            <li>To make the sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into melted butter until dissolved and bubbling, about 1 minute. Add reserved cooking liquid and vinegar; cook, stirring frequently, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and whisk in sour cream and mustard.</li>
            <li>Serve sauce alongside corned beef and vegetables.</li>
        </ol>
