        <h3>Description</h3>
        <a>This corned beef recipe is just like your Irish mama used to make. The brisket will melt in your mouth. Get a center cut of meat, not the point. It's super tender and slices nicely, just like butter. What little was leftover was made into a great hash the following morning.</a>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Luck</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread baby carrots, potatoes, and onion over the bottom of a slow cooker crock, then pour in water.</li>
            <li>Season brisket on the lean side with onion powder and garlic powder. Place brisket, seasoned-side down, onto vegetables. Pour beer over brisket, then sprinkle spice packet over top. Cover and cook on Low for 10 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer brisket to a cutting board. Stir cabbage into the liquid and vegetable mixture remaining in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on High until cabbage is tender, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice corned beef and serve with cabbage mixture.</li>
        </ol>
